## Assignment
For this project, you will build a client-side “Recipe Discovery” application. This project will serve as a comprehensive demonstration of your mastery of advanced React concepts. The application will allow users to browse recipes by category, search for specific recipes, view detailed recipe information, and manage a personal list of “favorite” recipes.

You will use a free, public API for recipe data and implement a varietys of hooks, state management patterns, and routing solutions to create a feature-rich, single-page application (SPA).
